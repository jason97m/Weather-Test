Airport Weather search by ICAO for Android Devices
This is an android based application.  The user is presented with a text box that allows input of an airport ICAO (KABQ for example).
The app queries public available weather information for the ICAO using METAR data service:  https://aviationweather.gov/metar?gis=off

Once an ICAO is input and the search button is pressed, a pop-up displays the latest weather observation.
